Do there exist real symmetric 3x3 matrices that are also orthogonal? If so give an example.

Yes, they exist. As by definition they don't contradict each other. An example is:
\begin{equation*}
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\frac{-7}{9} & \frac{4}{9} &\frac{4}{9}\\
		\frac{4}{9} & \frac{-1}{9} &\frac{8}{9}\\
		\frac{4}{9} & \frac{8}{9} &\frac{-1}{9}\\
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}
