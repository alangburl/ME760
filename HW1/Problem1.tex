For $\vec{a} \neq 0$, what does $\vec{a}\cdot \vec{b} = \vec{a}\cdot \vec{b}$ imply about the vectors $\vec{b}$ and $\vec{c}$? Give a geometric interpretation. Hint: if $\vec{a}$, $\vec{b}$, and $\vec{c}$ all begin at the same point, where do the ends of the vectors $\vec{b}$ and $\vec{c}$ lie? \\ 

\noindent This implies that the sum of $\vec{b}$ and $\vec{c}$ is perpindicular to $\vec{a}$. This is realized through rearranging the equation as $\vec{a}\cdot\left(\vec{b}-\vec{c}\right)=0$. This however, doesn't imply that $\vec{b}=\vec{c}$.
