Line $L$ passes through the two points $P_1=\left(-2,-2,-2\right)$ and $P_2=\left(-1,-1,-1\right)$.
\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
	\item What is the equation of this line?

	\item What are the coordinates of the two points of intersection of this line with a sphere of radius 2 centered at $\left( 2,2,2\right)$?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*)]
	\item The vector parallel to the line is $\vec{v}=\langle 1 1 1 \rangle$. Thus the equation of the line can be represented using the vector and point $P_1$ by the following set of parametric equations:
	
	\begin{equation*}
	\boxed{
		\vec{r}=\langle -2, -2,-2\rangle +t\langle 1, 1, 1 \rangle}
	\end{equation*}

	\item The previous solution can be rewrote into component form and substituted into the 
\end{enumerate}
