The flow of heat in a temperature field takes place in the direction of the maximum decrease of temperature. For the temperature field $T\left(x,y,z\right)=z/\left(x^2+y^2\right)$ find teh direction and magnitude of the heat flow in general and explicitly at the point $\left(0,1,2\right)$.

The direction
